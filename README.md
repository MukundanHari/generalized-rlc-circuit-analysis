Derivation of the differential equation, interpretation, and applications of the generalized RLC series circuit.

1) Motivation

I began an independent physics research portfolio, which involved derivation and application. The most recent project involved deriving certain equations that defined systems.
Following the derivations, I explain different applications for certain sub-cases of said system and how my generalized equation either simplified calculations or increased convenience.

This certain project was done following my completion of self-studying AP Physics C: Mechanics. Having investigated oscillatory behavior, I was curious about 
different cases of this outside of classical physics, which led me to finding out about the series RLC circuit. 

Electrical networks nowadays are incredibly complicated, both in terms of loop combinations and component number. The paper that I have just written is focused on component number and 
what happens to calculations when the number of components is arbitrary and applications of said specific cases of networks.

2) Goals 

The goal of this paper is to

- Derive the base case RLC series circuit, and provide a framework for the generalized derivation.
- Derive the differential equation for the generalized RLC series circuit with certain numbers n, m, and p, referring to the number of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, respectively.
- Investigate the similarities in the behavior of the base and generalized RLC series circuit.
- Investigate the mathematical, or conceptual, applications of the 3 sub-cases of the generalized RLC series circuit and how the generalized circuits are beneficial for such applications.

3) Potential future projects

The framework for this paper can be extended to other ideas, perhaps

- A derivation of parallel and RLC circuits with combinations of components such that the placement of the resistors, inductors, and capacitors is arbitrary along 3 loops.
- Experimental validation of applications spoken about in the paper
- Modelling the RLC series circuit without certain conditions, for example, mutual inductance or the voltage source and capacitor's internal resistance
- An investigation into other quantities in the generalized cases, perhaps impedance and reactance.
